Resume Builder Project
Author: Kevin Lanzing

What is this?
The Resume Builder is a unit from Udacity's Front-End and Full-Stack Developer nanodegrees. This one has been modified to
suit its author, Kevin Lanzing. The CSS has been customized, and Google Map integration has been added. Because this
resume is one page on a larger website, a navbar with buttons was added to the top.

How do I use this?
While you probably will not use this as-is, feel free to customize it to your liking. The resume page can be viewed simply
by opening "resume.html". However, it is the JS/resumeBuilder.js file that contains all the information you see, and
controls how it is displayed. CSS/style.css controls the look of the page. The IMG directory contains all of the image
files specified in resumeBuilder.js.

If I use this, who should I credit?
Udacity created the original template, and deserves most of the credit. Feel free to credit Kevin Lanzing if you found
this implementation of the resume project (navbar especially) to be particularly stylish. I don't expect much!
